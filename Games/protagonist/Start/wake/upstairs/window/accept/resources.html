		<!--Description-->
		<p>You duck, dodging the first bolt as your eyes quickly dart<br>
		around the room, looking for anything you can use to your<br>
		disposal. The room is completely bare, nothing decorates the <br>
		blank, bare walls except... no. Disgusting. Anything but that.<br>
		But it seems you have no choice. As the alien takes another<br>
		shot you dive against the wall, tearing the glaring eyeball out<br>
		of it's mechanical socket. It pulses in your hand as you throw<br>
		it with all your might at the hostile. It explodes on impact.<br>
		Sparks fly everywhere as the alien and the eye dissolve. A<br>
		compartment opens up, fashioned with only a single red button.<br>
		You have no option but to push it. You hear a clank, then a<br>
		BANG as a door opens and you are sucked into space. The giant<br>
		universe that surrounds you takes your breath away, your eyes<br>
		widen as you're exposed to the wonderous nebulas and galaxies<br>
		of </p>
