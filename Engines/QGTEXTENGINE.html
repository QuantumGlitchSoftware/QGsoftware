			<h3>QG Text Engine 1.0</h3>
			<a href="QGTEXTENGINE/qgtextenginedownload.html" download>Download html file</a>
			<h6>CC BY</h6>
			<p>This Engine is a text based game engine with textures and chance mechanics. It is a very simple engine, but it gets the job done. This engine and the tutorial below were made so that even if you don't know how to code, you should still be able to use this engine. You use this engine by directly editing the code, you can open it with a text editor like Notepad or Brackets. Anything between square brackets [ ], including the square brackets themselves, is safe to edit and customize. Wherever "NOTE:" appears is a little more complicated, but there are tutorials for each "NOTE:" prompt below. This Engine is protected by Copyright CC BY, which means you can do anything you want with it as long as you give credit to this site.</p>

			<h3>Tutorials:</h3>
			<p> The first note prompt is something like this:</p>
			<img src="textures/NoteOne.PNG"/>
			<p>This is the code that makes the buttons. Each line of code is responsible for rendering one button. Here, I'll color code each line so you can see what does what.</p>
			<img src="textures/Colors.PNG"/>
			<p>The code in the red box is responsible for the "A" button. The blue box for "B", The green for "C", and the yellow for "D". If you want to get rid of a choice, you have to remove the line of code that creates the button. All you have to do is highlight the line of code you want to remove, and pres backspace. It's that simple.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The second "NOTE:" looked like this:</p>
			<img src="textures/NoteTwo.PNG"/>
			<p>Now, this is where things get complicated, and I havent finished this tutorial yet so good luck. TODO: finish tutorial</p>
